### 🌟 Step-by-Step Explanation

#### 🔹 1) Create a Socket

```c
client_sock = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
```

A *socket* is like a phone.
Here we say:

* AF_INET → IPv4 network
* SOCK_STREAM → TCP connection
* 0 → Default protocol for TCP
  If socket fails, we quit with an error.

---

#### 🔹 2) Server Address Setup

```c
memset(&server_addr, 0, sizeof(server_addr));
server_addr.sin_family = AF_INET;
server_addr.sin_port = htons(8080);
server_addr.sin_addr.s_addr = inet_addr("127.0.0.1");
```

We tell the phone **which address to call**:

* `memset` → Clear memory to avoid garbage values
* `AF_INET` → Talking to an IPv4 server
* `htons(8080)` → Convert port to network byte order (server listens on port **8080**)
* `127.0.0.1` → Localhost (same machine)

So the client wants to call the server at:

```
IP: 127.0.0.1
PORT: 8080
```

---

#### 🔹 3) Connect to Server

```c
connect(client_sock, (struct sockaddr*)&server_addr, sizeof(server_addr))
```

This is like dialing the server’s phone.
If server accepts the call → connected!

---

#### 🔹 4) Send Message

```c
char *msg = "Hello from client!";
write(client_sock, msg, strlen(msg));
```

We speak into the phone:
“Hello from client!” 📢

`write()` sends bytes to the server.

---

#### 🔹 5) Receive Response

```c
int n = read(client_sock, buffer, sizeof(buffer)-1);
buffer[n] = '\0';
printf("Server says: %s\n", buffer);
```

Client listens back with `read()`.

* Stores message from server into buffer
* `buffer[n] = '\0'` adds string terminating character
* Prints server’s reply 🎤

---

#### 🔹 6) Close Socket

```c
close(client_sock);
```

Conversation done. Phone disconnected ☎️❌

Here comes the royal counterpart. Your **server code** is the castle gatekeeper that waits for a visitor (client), listens to what they say, and responds wisely. 🏰👂📨

Let’s break it down into clean chunks.

## 🧩 Step-by-Step Explanation

### 🔹 1) Create a Server Socket

```c
server_sock = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
```

A socket is like a telephone line waiting for calls.
Settings:

* AF_INET → IPv4
* SOCK_STREAM → TCP
* 0 → Default protocol

If creation fails → exit.

✅ Ready to communicate.

---

### 🔹 2) Define Server Address

```c
memset(&server_addr, 0, sizeof(server_addr));
server_addr.sin_family = AF_INET;
server_addr.sin_port = htons(8080);
server_addr.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY;
```

We configure:

* `AF_INET` → IPv4
* Port **8080** converted to network format
* `INADDR_ANY` → Listen on any available network interface
  (example: 127.0.0.1 or LAN IP like 192.168.1.x)

Memory is cleared first to avoid garbage values.

✅ Address ready.

---

### 🔹 3) Bind Socket to IP + Port

```c
bind(server_sock, (struct sockaddr*)&server_addr, sizeof(server_addr));
```

Binding connects the socket to a specific port.
Server claims:

```
I own port 8080 now!
```

If something else is using the port → fail.

✅ Port reserved for server communication.

---

### 🔹 4) Listen for Incoming Clients

```c
listen(server_sock, 5);
```

Server enters **wait mode** like a receptionist.
It can keep up to **5 pending clients** in line.

✅ “Listening…” message means server is ready.

---

### 🔹 5) Accept a Client

```c
client_sock = accept(server_sock, NULL, NULL);
```

Server picks up the ringing phone. ☎️
Now:

* server_sock keeps listening for others
* client_sock is the personal call with this client

✅ A specific client connection established!

---

### 🔹 6) Receive Client Message

```c
int n = read(client_sock, buffer, sizeof(buffer)-1);
buffer[n] = '\0';
printf("Client says: %s\n", buffer);
```

Server hears what client says:

* `read()` brings data into buffer
* `buffer[n] = '\0'` ends string properly

✅ Message safely received.

---

### 🔹 7) Send a Response

```c
char *msg = "Hello from server!";
write(client_sock, msg, strlen(msg));
```

Server replies politely 📢

✅ Return message sent.

---

### 🔹 8) Close Connections

```c
close(client_sock);
close(server_sock);
```

Server hangs up with the client
Then shuts down its phone line too.

✅ Conversation complete and resources freed.

## ✅ Full Flow Summary

| Step     | Action                 | Who speaks?     |
| -------- | ---------------------- | --------------- |
| socket() | Create server socket   | Server prepares |
| bind()   | Claim port 8080        | Server          |
| listen() | Wait for calls         | Server          |
| accept() | Answer client call     | Server          |
| read()   | Receive client message | Client →        |
| write()  | Send reply             | Server →        |

---

## 🧠 Together With The Client Code

Server: waits first
Client: connects second
Server: reads and replies
Client: prints and ends
Server: closes after response

---

FD = **File Descriptor** → a simple **integer** the OS gives you to identify your socket (or any open file).

* Example:

```c
int client_socket = socket(...);
printf("%d", client_socket); // prints FD like 3
```

* FD 3 means "this is the OS’s handle to your socket."

Basically, **it’s just a number that represents your socket**.
